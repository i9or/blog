# Hello, World!

~~My dear friend, I am writing to you with great sadness,~~ Have no idea what to write in the first blog post. Probably some plans? I don't know. I guess I should write how excited I am starting _yet another technical blog_, right?

---

Anyway, I am so excited about starting yet another technical blog about programming! Especially in 2022, where we have mass layoffs at IT and neural networks that threat the whole industry. Exciting!

I wrote my first program when I was still at secondary school. I think it was in 2001. Dotcom bubble just happened, Perl and HTML were the hottest things. I've heard about the Internet, but haven't had any access to it till the next year or something. Anyway, I wrote first program using M$ Visual Basic.

Was it exciting? Hell yeah it was. I instantly realized that's what I want to do my entire life. I don't need fame or money, just give me a computer with proper IDE and leave alone. Who would've told me that programming is actually a tedious, soul-sucking endeavor that will only lead to a disappointment and frustration in a long run. Especially if you decide to follow that foolish advice:

The more I become old the more I miss the old times. It was not easy back then, programming was always a challenge. But it still feels like it was a different type of challenge. Like the challenge of inventing a new reality, not a challenge where you fight with the complexity of your tools. Jokes aside, they even created neural networks, because selecting a new JavaScript library for React.js state management is not an easy task anymore! I hope AI will be able to cope with that, as I haven't seen any progress in AI psychoanalysis lately.

Perhaps another frustrating aspect of doing software development is the fact that, at the end of the day, your work will have a little impact on the world. I mean in a good way. Yes, some people do that, but at this point it seems like a statistically insignificant outcome. Many times not planned at all.

Rant.

No, I mean hear me out. Everything made by the software industry these days comes with a catch. You can log into Amazon and order anything you may imagine. No need to get off your couch! _"Ring ring, hello, is this the future?"_. But the best engineers with their 7-figure salaries decided that it's better to show you the same products over and over. And what you'll actually get delivered in one-day-turns-to-be-a-week paid delivery will be fake or even broken. Who cares about quality if the company spent a ton of money for that fancy dynamic web page running on a billion-dollar cloud infrastructure, right? That page is already an achievement, go enjoy your plastic whatever made in China by low-paid workforce. Oh, and the reviews are useless, by the way.

Then you have endless entertainment on services like YouTube! For free! But in reality it's all data collection. And the best engineers out there coded an algorithm that's dedicated to amplification of your worst aspects. Are you easily addicted? Here you go, watch some more useless videos of people fighting over their political preferences. Do you have short attention span? Here you go, we've introduced **YouTube Shorts™️**. It will entertain you to death, and recommend you towards the extremism. Nice.

Oh, social media. Best software engineers excelled here as well. You can use social media to try to stay in touch with your friends and family, maybe co-workers. But mostly it will make you feel depressed. Literally, there are a few research results already published proving that. Nice! Oh, and you will also need to self-censor and craft your social media profiles. Because you can't just fool around. Nowadays, your social media is your "brand". And you have to satisfy your potential employers. CVs are not enough these days, they will google the shit out of your social media before hiring. Nice.

You can have a tiny powerful smartphone in your pocket. The amount of storage and computing power is just ridiculous. And connectivity, oh my! The knowledge of the whole world... never mind, this plastic rectangle of existential terror was created to show more ads and do tracking. Have I told you that the best engineers had been working on it?

The grocery stores have so many choices; that's the most we ever had at any point in history (although, not everyone, just the West, but still). But the choice is actually an illusion since every brand is owned by a bunch of corporations. Like literally, you don't even need it to have all the fingers on your hands to count them all. The best part, those corporations can be caught poisoning their consumers for years, and they will not only stay in business. They will say "we are sorry" and get more profitable than ever.

It is very convenient to have all those things. That's not the problem though. The problem is those things are not designed to help us anymore. Everything you buy is made by corporations, and the best engineers who dedicated their time to delivering the barest minimum or less if possible to suck you into spending your money. Or if not money, then your precious attention, or just simply your personal data.

Oh yeah, the thing you've bought most probably isn't yours. You rented it. Have you read that EULA?

Gosh, I just wanted to make some video games God dammit...

So yes, I am stuck behind a computer screen all day, every day. Using programming language I hate. Probably contributing to the mess described above. My back hurts, my eyes are strained, and I've almost lost touch with the outside world ~~remote work my ass!~~. And I am planning to write a blog! About that! As the Dude once said:

> That's a great plan. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly. It's a Swiss fucking watch.
> — The Dude, "The Big Lebowski", 1998

We'll see. Knowing that this is a third attempt or something, it might completely not work out. Okay, I need to stop whining. Hopefully the next post will be better and more technical. Have a good one.
