  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This privacy policy explains how I collect, use, and disclose information
    through my personal technical blog ("Website"). By using my Website, you
    agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as
    described in this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Collection of Information</h2>

  <p>
    I don't personally collect information from you when you visit my Website,
    interact with my content, or contact me through the Website. However, I am
    using third party service providers such as Cloudflare. So they may or may
    not collect some of your information. Please reach out to their privacy
    policy. This information may include your IP address, browser type, device
    type, operating system, location, and browsing history. I may also collect
    information you voluntarily provide, such as your name, email address, and
    any other information you provide through forms or comments on the Website
    in the future (there are none at the moment).
  </p>

  <h2>Use of Information</h2>

  <p>
    Since I don't collect any information at the moment, there's no use of
    information either.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>

  <p>
    The only cookie is used on the Website is the one needed to store theme
    setting on your side. That cookie does not contain any personal information
    and therefore can't be used for tracking.
  </p>

  <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>

  <p>
    I do not sell or share your information with third parties for their
    marketing purposes. I may disclose your information to third parties if I
    believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal requirement, to
    protect the rights or property of me or others, or to prevent harm. I may
    also share your information with my service providers and partners who
    assist me in operating the Website and providing services to you.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>

  <p>
    I take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized
    access, use, or disclosure. However, no security measures are 100% effective
    and I cannot guarantee the security of your information.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

  <p>
    I may update this privacy policy from time to time. If I make changes, I
    will post the updated policy on the Website and update the "Effective Date"
    at the top of the policy. Your continued use of the Website after any
    changes indicates your acceptance of the new policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact Me</h2>

  <p>
    If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact me using
    this <a href="mailto:dont@bzzr.me">email</a>. Don't contact me if you're a
    spammer, please.
