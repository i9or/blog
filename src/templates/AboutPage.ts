    Welcome to my personal technical blog about programming and technology! My
    private digital garden, as they say nowadays. Here, you'll find posts about
    a variety of topics, mostly about outdated stuff, probably a lot of swearing
    and complaining. Probably the best thing to do is literally
    <em>ignore this page</em>, you have been warned.
  </p>

    This is actually around a third attempt to start a technical blog. At this
    point I've been stuck with programming for far too long, and now just trying
    to survive the daily grind by offloading thoughts from my head into
    something public place. So, the plan is simple ‚Äî write a bunch of posts
    about things I was never able to finish, hoping it will help me to mute
    endless stream of thoughts and self blaming üòÖ. Among the topics I plan to
    write about is low level game programming using C, computer graphics using
    legacy OpenGL, or web development without those modern JavaScript
    atrocities. Why? Because nostalgia is a hell of drug, and this blog is just
    a way to return to those happy times virtually.

    Also, feedback is not welcome üòÇüëç, that's basically why I am not planning
    to add comment section or share my contact details (although there's a link
    to my Mastodon somewhere on this website). Don't follow me, don't share my
    links, don't hit that like button (there's no such button anyway). As
    already mentioned above, <em>ignore this page</em> for the good.

    Thank you for visiting my blog anyway, hope you won't any strong feelings
    one way or the other about my hot takes and badly formatted ramblings!
