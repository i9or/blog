  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my personal technical blog about programming and technology! My
    private digital garden, as they say, nowadays. My name is Igor, by the way.
    You can easily find that this name is usually automatically adjusted to
    <em>Ignore</em> by many spellcheckers. Hence, the name of this blog. Here,
    you'll find posts about a variety of topics, mostly about outdated stuff,
    and probably a lot of swearing and complaining. Possibly the best thing to
    do is <em>ignore this page</em>, you have been warned.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is actually around a third attempt to start a technical blog. At this
    point, I've been stuck with programming for far too long, and now just
    trying to survive the daily grind by offloading thoughts from my head into
    some public space. So, the plan is simple: write a bunch of posts about
    things I was never able to finish, hoping it will help me to mute an endless
    stream of thoughts and self-blaming üòÖ. Among the topics, I plan to write
    about are low-level game programming using C, computer graphics using legacy
    OpenGL, or web development without those modern JavaScript atrocities. Why?
    Because nostalgia is a hell of a drug, this blog is just a way to return to
    those happy times virtually.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, feedback is not welcome üòÇüëç, that's basically why I am not planning
    to add a comment section or share my contact details (although there's a
    link to my Mastodon somewhere on this website). Don't follow me, don't share
    my links, and don't hit that like button (there's no such button anyway). As
    already mentioned above, <em>ignore this page</em> for the good.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for visiting my blog anyway, hope you won't have any strong
    feelings one way or the other about my hot takes and badly formatted
    ramblings!
